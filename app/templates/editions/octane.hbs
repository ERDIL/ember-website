  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <dl class="dl-faq">
    <dt>Which release of Ember is Octane?</dt>
    <dd>
      In December 2019, [Ember 3.15](https://blog.emberjs.com/ember-3-15-released) was declared to be Ember Octane.
    </dd>
    <dt>Do I need to refactor my whole app in order to use Octane features?</dt>
    <dd>
      Good news - you do not need to change your whole app to use Octane's features! 
      You can opt into them, one at a time. Some features are even available in earlier versions.
      You can read more about features and upgrade strategies in
      <a href="https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/12/20/octane-is-here.html">the official Ember blog post</a>.
      Check out the [cheat sheet](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/upgrading/current-edition/cheat-sheet/) to see what the syntax changes look like in practice.
    </dd>
    <dt>If I want to upgrade my app to Octane, do I need to make all the changes by hand?</dt>
    <dd>
      No, codemods and CLI tools are available to help you.
      Visit the <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/release/upgrading/current-edition">Octane Upgrade Guide</a> to learn more about them.
    </dd>
    <dt>If I'm not ready to use Octane, does that mean I should keep my app on version 3.14?</dt>
    <dd>
      No, you should go ahead and update to version 3.15 or later.
      Octane's big changes are all opt-in, meaning that you can enable them when you are ready, and in the meantime, you can keep updating your app as you normally would.
    </dd>
    <dt>I'm starting a new app at work. Should I use Octane?</dt>
    <dd>
      Yes! Octane is stable and well supported.
      It is the present and future of Ember, so you are saving yourself some upgrade work down the line.
      Be sure to budget some time for learning and experimentation.
      From Ember 3.15 onwards, if you start a new app and use Ember CLI commands like `ember generate component` to create
      your files, you are using Octane!
